# ran


**Description:** Authentication service for machine to machine credentials.  Implements the client credentials grant flow of Oauth2 spec.  
* source of truth for machine credentials and registry.
* s2s jwt mint.
* utilizes my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project for core microservice functionality.

**Name:** _Ran is the name of one of two twin dragons in Avatar.  This service's authentication counterpart will be the Shaw (second dragon) user service which will handle human credentials_
* _Ran (ç‡ƒ) means "burn" or "ignite" in Chinese, and since all services need to get service credentials before taking any other action, the ignite side of the dragon pair seemed appropriate._
